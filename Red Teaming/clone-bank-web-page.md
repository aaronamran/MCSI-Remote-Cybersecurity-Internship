# Clone The Authentication Web Page Of A Bank And Steal User Credentials
Fake login pages are a common and effective spear-phishing tactic, tricking users into entering credentials on sites that closely mimic legitimate ones. Once users input their details, attackers gain access and can steal their data

## Tasks
- Create a self-hosted web application that replicates the authentication page of the chosen bank
- Develop a backend mechanism to store captured credentials. Modify the HTML form action to direct the submitted data to your backend processing script
- Implement code to capture and securely store the submitted username and password data. Store this data in a backend .txt file with restricted access
- After capturing the credentials, devise a redirection mechanism that seamlessly guides users to the authentic web page of the bank

## Benchmarks
- Launch the self-hosted web application and demonstrate its visual resemblance to the authentic bank's login page
- Simulate a user interaction by entering fictitious username and password details
- Illustrate the backend .txt file that captures the entered credentials
- Emphasize the redirection to the actual bank's website, highlighting how the user is unaware of the malicious activity

## Practical Approach
