# Perform Threat Hunting Against 2 Machines
A threat hunter can use Python's pandas to find indicators of compromise by merging data from different sources, helping to uncover missed malicious activity. Pandas also enables data visualization through charts and graphs, revealing hidden patterns. Additionally, it allows filtering of data to focus on specific threats for further investigation.

## Hints
The following attacks in the dataset can be found:
- Malicious Windows commands
- Using Accessibility Features for persistence
- Modifying a Windows Service
- Searching for credentials in the registry
- Path Interception
- Process Injection

## Tasks
1. Download the threat hunting dataset provided for this exercise
2. Use Python and Pandas to analyze the dataset and identify the compromised machine
3. Use a Jupyter Notebook to perform your Threat Hunts and submit it as a PDF file as part of your submission files
4. Submit a comprehensive report adhering to the requirements below
   Your report must include the following sections:
   - Executive Summary: Provide a concise overview of your findings and the significance of identifying the compromised machine
   - Compromised Machines: Clearly state the machine you have identified as compromised, providing evidence from the dataset to support your conclusions
   - Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): Explain the identified IOCs in simple language suitable for an audience unfamiliar with threat hunting or digital forensics
   - Recommendations: Offer practical recommendations for recovering the compromised system and preventing similar attacks in the future
   - Limitations and Constraints: List any limitations or constraints you faced during your analysis, which may have impacted the scope or accuracy of your findings
   - Assumptions: Clearly state any assumptions you made while conducting your analysis
