# Write A YARA Rule That Identifies Chinese Executables
YARA rules are powerful tools for threat hunting, enabling quick identification of malware and malicious files. Threat hunters use them to scan systems and track infections. In the Portable Executable (PE) format, the compiler populates a field with the computerâ€™s language ID. However, adversaries can manipulate this value to deceive threat intelligence and malware analysts.

## Tasks
1. Complete the following prerequisites first:
   - [Lab Setup: Threat Hunting With YARA](https://github.com/aaronamran/MCSI-Remote-Cybersecurity-Internship/blob/main/Threat%20Hunting/threat-hunting-yara.md)
   - [Lab Setup: Malware Dataset](https://github.com/aaronamran/MCSI-Remote-Cybersecurity-Internship/blob/main/Threat%20Hunting/malware-dataset.md)
   - [Write A YARA Rule That Is Professionally Documented](https://github.com/aaronamran/MCSI-Remote-Cybersecurity-Internship/blob/main/Threat%20Hunting/pro-documented-yara-rule.md)
2. Write a YARA rule that has the following characteristics:
   - Only detect files that are Portable Executables (PEs)
   - Only detect Portable Executables configured with language identifiers 0x04 or 0x004 (Chinese)
3. Save the YARA rule as "chinese_exe.yar" in a location on the hard drive
4. Follow along with the 'YARA Rules Testing' guideline and test your rule
5. Confirm that the YARA rule correctly identifies Portable Executables with language identifiers 0x04 or 0x004 (Chinese)
