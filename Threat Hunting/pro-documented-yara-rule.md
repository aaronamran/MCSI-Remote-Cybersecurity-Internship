# Write A YARA Rule That Is Professionally Documented
In cybersecurity, clear communication is vital. Properly documenting YARA rules ensures team members understand their purpose without needing to reverse-engineer them. Including metadata like author info, version numbers, and reference URLs enhances threat detection and response
<br/>
When documenting YARA rules, consider the following:
- Naming Convention: Use clear, descriptive names that reflect the malware targeted, enabling easy identification and organization
- Informative Comments: Add comments that explain the ruleâ€™s logic and any special considerations, helping other analysts understand its purpose and design

## YARA Rules Guidelines
When documenting YARA rules, it is important to keep a few things in mind. First, be sure to use a clear and concise style, which will make the rules easy to read and understand. Additionally, be sure to use professional formatting, which will make the rules look polished and professional. Finally, be sure to document any caveats or restrictions that may be associated with the rule

- Naming Convention <br/>
Use a naming convention. We recommend that you watch the video that Kaspersky kindly provided us where they share their name convention (which is excellent).

- Use the Metadata section <br/>
YARA rules can contain a metada section. Use it to its full potential.

- Metadata: description <br/>
Enter a concise description of what the rule is meant to detect and how to best use it

- Metadata: author <br/>
Include your name and email

- Metadata: MD5/SHA1/SHA256 <br/>
Provide one or several examples of file hashes that the YARA rule is meant to detect

- Metadata: version <br/>
Include the version of the rule. For example: 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 etc.

- Metadata: references <br/>
Include references to online materials that are relevant to the YARA rule (e.g. threat reports, virus total files etc.)

- Code Indentation <br/>
Properly indent your code! Make it easy for other people to read it and rapidly understand it.


## YARA Rules Testing Guidelines
1. Create a test dataset and validate your rule(s) against it <br/>
Create a small dataset of less than 20 files to initially test your YARA rules against. Make sure that this dataset contains positive and negative files. Confirm with absolute certainty that your YARA rule(s) work against this dataset before moving on to the next step.

2. Test your rule(s) against a large dataset <br/>
Now test your rule against a large dataset (i.e. 5GB+ of random files). This could be as simple as scanning your C: drive on Windows. Confirm that no false positives are returned.

3. Test your rule(s) against a goodware and a malware dataset <br/>
If you're writing rules to detect malware samples then make sure to validate that your rules do not detect false positive by first scanning a large goodware dataset (10GB+). Only once that's been confirmed that you can scan your malware dataset.


## Tasks
Create a YARA rule using either legitimate or bogus malware data
Professionally document your YARA rule making sure to include all the Metadata listed below
- Author - Provide the name of the author who created the YARA rule
- Author's email - Include the email address of the rule's author for contact purposes
- Example of a MD5 hash - Include an example MD5 hash of a known malware sample that the rule is designed to detect
- Date of creation - Add the date when the rule was initially written
- Version number - Specify the version number of the YARA rule to facilitate rule updates and tracking
- Reference URL - Include a URL to an online webpage that provides more information about the malware sample that the rule detects
- Type of malware - Indicate the type of malware the rule detects (e.g., APT, Ransomware, Adware, etc.)
