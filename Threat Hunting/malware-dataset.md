# Lab Setup: Malware Dataset
Malware datasets are an important resource for security researchers. They allow researchers to study malware and develop defenses against it. The datasets also help to identify new malware families and variants.
<br/>
<br/>
You can modify the malware dataset folder permissions to ensure that samples are only 'read' and not 'executed'. Research how this can be implemented on Windows (hint: folder permissions) and Linux (hint: 'chmod' command).
On Windows computers, you can also exclude the malware dataset folder from antivirus scanning.

## Notes
#### VM Storage Space
- If the Windows VM in VirtualBox does not have enough space to store the malware dataset, go to VirtualBox > Tools > Select a VM > Properties and increase the disk size as needed <br/>

- Power on the VM, and right-click on the Windows Icon. Select Disk Management and focus on Disk 0 (Virtual Hard Drive). Right-click on the C: drive and extend the volume
- If the "Extend Volume" is greyed out, run command prompt as admin 
- Type `DiskPart` and press Enter
- Type `list disk` and press Enter. This command will display all the available disks
- Select the disk that you want to extend. For example, if you want to extend disk 0, type `select disk 0` and press Enter
- Type `list partition` and press Enter. This will list all the partitions on the disk
- In the Type column, look for the partition that says Recovery. Note the partition number. For example, if the partition number is 4, type `select partition 4` and press Enter. This will select the recovery partition
- To delete the recovery partition, type `delete partition override` and press Enter
- You will see the message DiskPart successfully deleted the selected partition. This indicates that the recovery partition has been deleted
- Return to Disk Management window and the C: Drive can now be extended

## Folder Permissions

- If users of the computer are all admins, and the 'Read & Execute' permissions cannot be disabled, click on the 'Advanced' button
- Click 'Disable Inheritance', and choose 'Convert inherited permissions into explicit permissions'
- Back in the Advanced Security Settings, click 'Edit' for the target group, and uncheck 'Read & Execute' permissions and apply the changes



## Tasks
- Download a broad range of malware samples, including files such as PDF, EXE, JS, etc
- Organize and store the downloaded samples securely in a separate directory to create your malware dataset
- Ensure that the total size of your malware dataset is over 5GB
