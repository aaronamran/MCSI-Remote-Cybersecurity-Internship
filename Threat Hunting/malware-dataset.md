# Lab Setup: Malware Dataset
Malware datasets are an important resource for security researchers. They allow researchers to study malware and develop defenses against it. The datasets also help to identify new malware families and variants.
<br/>
You can modify the malware dataset folder permissions to ensure that samples are only 'read' and not 'executed'. Research how this can be implemented on Windows (hint: folder permissions) and Linux (hint: 'chmod' command).
On Windows computers, you can also exclude the malware dataset folder from antivirus scanning.
