# Write A YARA Rule That Can Find Small Portable Executables
YARA rules are powerful for threat hunting, helping detect malware by scanning systems for malicious files. When targeting Windows Portable Executables (PE files), YARA rules can identify them through their signature, .exe extension, and embedded malware. The `pe` module in YARA is useful for writing and testing rules specifically against PE files, aiding malware analysis and detection.
