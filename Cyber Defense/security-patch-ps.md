# Write A PS Script To List Missing Security Patches
Keeping your software up to date is crucial for security. Security patches fix known vulnerabilities, and if they're not installed, attackers can exploit these weaknesses to access your system. To stay protected, ensure all applications have the latest security patches.


## Tasks
- Write a PowerShell script that can identify missing security patches on a local Windows machine
- Include the necessary PowerShell cmdlets to query Windows Update or the Windows Update Agent for patch information
- Extend the script to allow remote scanning of Windows machines for missing security patches
- Provide options to input remote machine names or IP addresses for scanning
- Implement a feature in the script to list the security hotfixes and patches already installed on the target machine
- Display the installed patches in an organized and user-friendly manner
- Provide informative output messages that display the missing security patches, if any, on the target machine
- Include details such as the KB number, patch description, and severity level


## Benchmarks
- Run the script locally and demonstrate that it correctly identifies installed and\or missing patches
- Run the script against a remote machine and demonstrate that it correctly identifies installed and\or missing patches
