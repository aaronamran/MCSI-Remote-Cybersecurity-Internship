# Perform A Vulnerability Scan With OpenVAS
OpenVAS is a vulnerability assessment tool designed to scan networks for potential security weaknesses. It can identify vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, and databases, as well as assess the security of networks and systems.

## Tasks
- Setup 1 attacker machine (Kali Linux) and 3 target machines (Windows 10, Lubuntu, Windows 7)
- Research common vulnerabilities that OpenVAS can identify
- Select a practical vulnerability and simulate it within Windows 7
- Initiate a vulnerability scan against Windows 10 VM and display scan reports generated by OpenVAS
- Initiate a vulnerability scan against Lubuntu VM and display scan reports generated by OpenVAS
- Initiate a vulnerability scan against Windows 7 VM and display scan reports generated by OpenVAS
  

## Solutions With Screenshots
Chosen Vulnerability: Enabling SMBv1 via Registry (Without PowerShell)
- Since PowerShell 1.0 can't handle the commands to check or enable SMBv1, it needs to enable it manually via the registry or using the Control Panel
- Open Registry Editor (regedit.exe)
- Navigate to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters`
- Create a new DWORD (32-bit) value: Name it: SMB1 and set its value to 1 (to enable SMBv1)
- After this, restart the machine to apply the changes
