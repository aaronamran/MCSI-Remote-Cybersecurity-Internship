# Write a Web Application Penetration Testing Checklist
A web application penetration testing checklist helps security testers identify and address vulnerabilities in web applications. It includes tests like scanning for CVEs, penetration testing, and fuzzing. By following a structured checklist, testers can effectively assess and mitigate security risks, improving the application's overall security.
