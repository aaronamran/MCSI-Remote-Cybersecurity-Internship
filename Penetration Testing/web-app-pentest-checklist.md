# Write a Web Application Penetration Testing Checklist
A web application penetration testing checklist helps security testers identify and address vulnerabilities in web applications. It includes tests like scanning for CVEs, penetration testing, and fuzzing. By following a structured checklist, testers can effectively assess and mitigate security risks, improving the application's overall security.

## Tasks
- Research and identify at least fifty (50) unique web application vulnerabilities commonly encountered in penetration testing
- Categorize and sort the vulnerabilities in a logical manner
- Present your checklist in a table format using a Word editor or a spreadsheet
- Include a tickbox next to each vulnerability to track whether the vulnerability has been tested or not
- Assign a unique identifier to each group or category of vulnerabilities for easy reference and tracking
- Include a column to list tools that can be used to test each group of vulnerabilities
- Add a column to note whether a test for each vulnerability was performed or not
- Include a column to record the results of each test (e.g., passed, failed, partially failed) and provide remarks, observations, or comments on each vulnerability

## Guidelines
- Tickboxes: Ensure that every item in your checklist has a tickbox. Users must be able to tick items as they go
- Numbering: Ensure that every item is numbered. This reading aid makes checklist easier to use
- Results: Ensure that users can note the results of items. For example: PASS, FAIL, or PARTIALLY PASS
- Remarks and Comments: Ensure that users can enter remarks and/or comments. For example, if an item is failed, then users must be able to explain why
- Categories: Items should be grouped and categorized logically
- Visual Aids: Help the reader rapidly understand the checklist using visual aids such as color coding and headings
